 *                    FM Pre-Emphasis Filter Implementation
 *
 * =====================================================================================
 *
 * File:         PreemphasisFilter.cpp
 * Description:  Real-time first-order IIR pre-emphasis filter for FM broadcast
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   This implementation provides the critical FM broadcast pre-emphasis function,
 *   a standardized high-frequency boost applied before transmission. FM receivers
 *   apply complementary de-emphasis filtering to restore flat response and reduce
 *   high-frequency noise prevalent in the RF channel.
 *
 * Filter Architecture:
 *   Leaky differentiator (first-order high‑pass):
 *     y[n] = gain · (x[n] − α · x[n−1])
 *
 *   Frequency response (75 μs time constant):
 *     • Low frequencies: 0 dB (flat)
 *     • Mid frequencies: +3 dB point near 2.1 kHz
 *     • High frequencies: +20 dB/decade asymptote
 *
 *   This creates the standard FM pre‑emphasis curve, boosting treble before
 *   transmission. Receivers apply complementary de‑emphasis to flatten response.
 *
 * Implementation Details:
 *   • Single-pass per-sample processing
 *   • Separate state for left and right (no crosstalk)
 *   • No clamping: saturation handled downstream in DSP pipeline
 *   • Interleaved stereo buffer (L/R pairs) for I2S compatibility
 *
 * Initialization:
 *   Alpha coefficient must be configured via configure() before processing begins.
 *   Typical values at ADC rate (e.g., 48 kHz):
 *     • 75 μs pre-emphasis: α ≈ 0.015 (time constant / fs)
 *     • 50 μs pre-emphasis: α ≈ 0.020 (European standard)
 *
 * Headroom Management:
 *   Pre-emphasis boosts high frequencies and can increase peak levels by ~3–6 dB
 *   in typical music content. Callers should apply appropriate gain reduction or
 *   limiting if required.
 *
 * Performance:
 *   Per-sample cost: 4 multiplications, 2 additions (~0.1 µs @ ESP32-S3)
 *   Minimal latency: < 1 µs per block @ ADC rate (e.g., 48 kHz)
