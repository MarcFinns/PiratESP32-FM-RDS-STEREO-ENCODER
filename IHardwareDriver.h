 * File:         IHardwareDriver.h
 * Description:  Pure virtual interface for hardware I/O operations
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Defines the contract for hardware drivers. This allows DSP_pipeline to work
 *   with different hardware implementations without modification.
 *
 * Design Pattern:
 *   • Interface Segregation: Minimal, focused interface
 *   • Dependency Inversion: DSP_pipeline depends on abstraction, not concrete driver
 *   • Testability: Mock implementations can be injected for unit testing
 *
 * Implementations:
 *   • ESP32I2SDriver: Hardware I2S driver for ESP32-S3
 *   • MockHardwareDriver: For testing (future)

/**
 * Hardware Driver Interface
 *
 * Pure virtual interface for audio I/O hardware abstraction.
 * Provides minimal, focused API for I2S operations required by DSP_pipeline.
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 *   All operations are designed to be called from a single task context (audio task).
 *   Not thread-safe for concurrent operations.

     * Sets up both input (ADC) and output (DAC) I2S peripherals.
     * This is the main initialization entry point.
     *
     * Initialization Order:
     *   1. TX peripheral (192 kHz DAC output) - must be first for MCLK stability
     *   2. Wait ~100 ms for master clock stabilization
     *   3. RX peripheral (48 kHz ADC input)
     *   4. Verify I2S channels are ready for operation
     *
     * Returns:
     *   true  - All hardware initialized successfully, ready for read/write
     *   false - Initialization failed (check logs for details)
     *
     * Note: Must be called once during system startup, before first read/write.

    /**
     * Read Audio Data from Input (ADC via I2S RX)
     *
     * Blocking read of one audio block from the I2S RX peripheral.
     * This is the primary path for capturing input audio.
     *
     * Buffer Format:
     *   • int32_t array, interleaved stereo: [L0, R0, L1, R1, L2, R2, ...]
     *   • Q31 fixed-point format (24-bit audio in 32-bit container)
     *   • Stereo pairs only: frames_to_read = bytes / (2 * 4)
     *
     * Parameters:
     *   buffer:           Destination buffer (int32_t array)
     *   buffer_bytes:     Size of buffer in bytes (must be multiple of 8)
     *   bytes_read:       [OUT] Actual bytes read (updated by implementation)
     *   timeout_ms:       Maximum wait time in milliseconds (0 = wait forever)
     *
     * Returns:
     *   true  - Data read successfully (check bytes_read for amount)
     *   false - Read failed (timeout, I2S error, or hardware issue)
     *
     * Blocking Behavior:
     *   • Blocks until DMA buffer contains requested amount of data
     *   • Typical block time: ~1.33 ms @ 48 kHz (one audio block period)
     *   • Can timeout if I2S clock is stopped or missing
     *
     * Error Handling:
     *   • Returns false on timeout or hardware error
     *   • bytes_read indicates partial data if applicable
     *
     * Thread Safety:
     *   Safe only when called from single task context (audio task).

     * Returns:
     *   true  - Data written successfully (check bytes_written for confirmation)
     *   false - Write failed (timeout, I2S error, or DAC issue)
