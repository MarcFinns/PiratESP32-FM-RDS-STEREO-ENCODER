## Failing Tests (6/33 - 19%)

### 1. ✗ RDS:PI with Hex Value (0x52A1)
**Status:** CRITICAL BUG
**Command:** `RDS:PI 0x52A1`
**Expected:** Sets PI to 0x52A1 and returns it in GET
**Received:** PI is set to 0x0000 instead
**Root Cause:** Line 833-836 in Console.cpp - The hex parsing code looks correct, but there may be an issue with how the `rest` pointer is being set or the leading whitespace is handled.

```cpp
if (strncmp(rest, "0x", 2) == 0 || strncmp(rest, "0X", 2) == 0)
    v = (unsigned)strtoul(rest, nullptr, 16);
else
    v = (unsigned)strtoul(rest, nullptr, 10);
```

The code appears to correctly parse hex, but `rest` may have leading whitespace not properly skipped.

---

### 2. ✗ RDS:PTY Numeric Values (10, 15)
**Status:** CRITICAL BUG
**Command:** `RDS:PTY 10`
**Expected:** Sets PTY to 10, returns `OK PTY=10`
**Received:** `ERR BAD_VALUE`
**Root Cause:** Line 903 in Console.cpp - The code checks if the first character of `rest` is a digit:

```cpp
if (rest[0] >= '0' && rest[0] <= '9')
    v = (unsigned)strtoul(rest, nullptr, 10);
else
    // Tries to match as PTY name, fails with BAD_VALUE
```

**Issue:** The `rest` pointer likely has leading whitespace that's never trimmed! The code at line 855-857 attempts to trim `rs`, but it doesn't update the actual `rest` pointer used for numeric checking.

```cpp
const char *rs = rest;
while (*rs == ' ' || *rs == '\t')
    ++rs;
```

This creates a local `rs` variable but then the numeric check still uses the untrimmed `rest` at line 903.

---

### 3. ✗ SYST:COMM:JSON ON
**Status:** MINOR ISSUE (Test Expectation Problem)
**Command:** `SYST:COMM:JSON ON`
**Expected:** Response should be checked for "OK"
**Received:** `{"ok":true}` (valid JSON response)
**Root Cause:** This is actually working correctly - once JSON mode is enabled, the response IS in JSON format. The test was incorrectly expecting a text-mode response. This is correct behavior.

---

### 4. ✗ CONSISTENCY Test - 20 Rapid RDS:PTY Commands
**Status:** RELATED TO BUG #2
**Test:** Sending `RDS:PTY 0` through `RDS:PTY 19` in rapid succession
**Result:** 0/20 commands succeeded
**Root Cause:** All failed due to the whitespace bug in PTY numeric parsing (Bug #2).

---

### 5. ✗ Error Handling - RDS:PI with no argument
**Status:** MINOR ISSUE
**Command:** `RDS:PI` (missing argument)
**Expected:** Should return `ERR MISSING_ARG`
**Received:** `OK` (no value set, but no error)
**Root Cause:** Line 826 checks `if (!rest)` but `rest` might be pointing to a non-null but empty string. The condition should check both null pointer AND empty string.

---

## Stability and Consistency Analysis

**Key Finding:** ✓ **Command processor does NOT degrade over time**

- Tested 76 commands sequentially
- No errors due to queue overflow or command processor fatigue
- Response times remain consistent
- No "ERR" responses that shouldn't be there (except for parsing bugs)
- Commands that work correctly continue to work throughout the test

**Observation:** The failing consistency test (0/20 PTY commands) failed immediately, not after degradation - this is the whitespace parsing bug, not a stability issue.

---

## Issues Identified

### Issue #1: PTY Numeric Parsing - Whitespace Not Trimmed
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**File:** Console.cpp, line 847-954
**Problem:** The `rest` pointer passed to PTY numeric parsing contains leading whitespace, but the code only checks if the first character is a digit without trimming first.

**Code Location:**
```cpp
else if (iequal(item_tok, "PTY"))
{
    if (!rest) { err("MISSING_ARG"); }
    else
    {
        const char *rs = rest;
        while (*rs == ' ' || *rs == '\t')  // ← Trims into local 'rs'
            ++rs;
        // ... LIST? check ...
        unsigned v = 0;
        if (rest[0] >= '0' && rest[0] <= '9')  // ← But checks original 'rest'!
            v = (unsigned)strtoul(rest, nullptr, 10);
```

**Impact:** All numeric PTY values fail with `ERR BAD_VALUE`

---

### Issue #2: RDS PI Hex Parsing
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**File:** Console.cpp, line 824-839
**Problem:** Hex values like `0x52A1` are being set as `0x0000` instead.

**Code Location:**
```cpp
if (iequal(item_tok, "PI"))
{
    if (!rest) { err("MISSING_ARG"); }
    else
    {
        unsigned v = 0;
        if (strncmp(rest, "0x", 2) == 0 || strncmp(rest, "0X", 2) == 0)
            v = (unsigned)strtoul(rest, nullptr, 16);
        else
            v = (unsigned)strtoul(rest, nullptr, 10);
        RDSAssembler::setPI((uint16_t)(v & 0xFFFF));
        ok();
    }
}
```

**Possible Root Cause:** The `rest` pointer may have leading whitespace, causing `strtoul` to fail to parse. Alternative: `strtoul` may be returning 0 when given "0x..." with leading spaces.

---

### Issue #3: Missing Argument Detection
**Severity:** MINOR
**File:** Console.cpp, lines 826-828 (and similar patterns)
**Problem:** `if (!rest)` check doesn't catch empty strings, only null pointers.

**Code Location:**
```cpp
if (!rest) { err("MISSING_ARG"); }
```

Should be:
```cpp
if (!rest || !rest[0] || (*rest == ' ' && !*(rest + 1)))
    err("MISSING_ARG");
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis - Whitespace Handling

Looking at the token parsing (lines 754-780), the `rest` pointer is set after extracting GROUP and ITEM tokens:

```cpp
const char *sp = line;
char group_tok[32];
char item_tok[64];
next_token(sp, group_tok, sizeof(group_tok));
next_token(sp, item_tok, sizeof(item_tok));
const char *rest = sp;  // ← This points to whatever's left, WITH leading spaces
```

The `next_token` function (lines 755-773) skips delimiters but `rest` captures whatever remains, including whitespace between the ITEM token and the value.

**Example Input:** `RDS:PTY 10`
1. `group_tok` = "RDS"
2. `item_tok` = "PTY"
3. `rest` = " 10" (leading space!)
4. Check at line 903: `rest[0]` is `' '` (space), not `'1'`
5. Falls through to PTY name matching, which fails → `ERR BAD_VALUE`

---

## Fixing Plan (Without Implementation)

### Fix 1: Trim `rest` pointer before use
**Affected Commands:** RDS:PI, RDS:PTY, RDS:TP, RDS:TA, RDS:MS, PILOT:THRESH, PILOT:HOLD, etc.

**Approach:**
Add a universal whitespace trimming step at line 780, immediately after setting `rest`:
```cpp
const char *rest = sp;
// Trim leading whitespace from rest
while (*rest == ' ' || *rest == '\t')
    rest++;
```

Alternatively, create a helper lambda at the top of the parsing section:
```cpp
auto skip_spaces = [](const char *p) -> const char * {
    while (*p == ' ' || *p == '\t')
        ++p;
    return p;
};
```

Then use it everywhere: `rest = skip_spaces(rest)` or at each usage point.

**Impact:** Fixes RDS:PI hex parsing and RDS:PTY numeric parsing immediately.

---

### Fix 2: Proper empty-string detection
**Affected Commands:** Any command requiring an argument

**Current Code:**
```cpp
if (!rest) { err("MISSING_ARG"); }
```

**Better Code:**
```cpp
const char *trimmed = skip_spaces(rest);
if (!trimmed || !*trimmed) { err("MISSING_ARG"); }
```

**Impact:** Properly rejects commands with missing arguments.

---

### Fix 3: Improve PTY parsing code clarity
**Current Issue:** The PTY handler has a local `rs` variable that trims whitespace, but then checks the original `rest`. This is confusing and buggy.

**Recommended Change:**
```cpp
else if (iequal(item_tok, "PTY"))
{
    if (!rest) { err("MISSING_ARG"); }
    else
    {
        const char *rs = skip_spaces(rest);  // Use the helper
        if (strncmp(rs, "LIST?", 5) == 0)
        {
            // ... LIST handling ...
        }
        else if (rs[0] >= '0' && rs[0] <= '9')  // Check trimmed version
        {
            unsigned v = (unsigned)strtoul(rs, nullptr, 10);
            // ...
        }
        else
        {
            // ... name matching ...
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1 - Apply Fixes 1 & 2:** Add whitespace trimming to prevent PTY and PI parsing failures. This resolves the majority of issues.

2. **Priority 2 - Add defensive coding:** Ensure the parsing logic explicitly handles empty/whitespace-only values.

3. **Priority 3 - Add integration tests:** Create automated tests that run after each code change to catch parsing regressions.

4. **Priority 4 - Code review:** The current command parsing uses many small lambdas and local logic. Consider refactoring into a cleaner, more testable state machine or command router.

---

## Conclusion

**The command processor is functionally stable and does not degrade over time.** The three critical issues are all related to whitespace handling in the token parsing logic. These are **easily fixable parsing bugs**, not fundamental architecture problems.

Once the whitespace trimming is applied universally, the command processor should achieve 100% pass rate on the test suite. The underlying queue system, JSON mode toggle, and communication layer all work correctly.
