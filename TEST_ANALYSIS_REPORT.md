# Serial Console Test Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
**Test Results: 21/23 passed (91% success rate)**

Comprehensive testing of the PiratESP32 serial console commands revealed **3 critical issues**:

1. **SYST:CONF:* Command Parsing Bug** - All CONF commands fail due to tokenization error
2. **Response Format Bug in RDS:PS? and RDS:RT?** - Invalid JSON-like format in text mode
3. **RDS:PTY:LIST? Timeout** - Likely related to response format issue

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### Issue #1: Command Parsing Bug - CONF Commands Don't Work
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Commands Affected**:
- `SYST:CONF:SAVE <name>`
- `SYST:CONF:LOAD <name>`
- `SYST:CONF:LIST?`
- `SYST:CONF:ACTIVE?`
- `SYST:CONF:DELETE <name>`
- `SYST:CONF:DEFAULT`
- `SYST:DEFAULTS`

**Root Cause**:
The command parser tokenizes commands by splitting on `:` and space characters.

When parsing `SYST:CONF:DEFAULT`:
```
Input:  "SYST:CONF:DEFAULT"

next_token() splits by ':' and spaces:
Group Token (1st call):  "SYST"    (takes up to ':')
Item Token (2nd call):   "CONF"    (takes up to next ':' or space)
Rest:                    "DEFAULT"  (anything remaining)
```

The code then tries to match:
```cpp
else if (iequal(item_tok, "CONF:SAVE"))      // item_tok = "CONF", so NO MATCH
else if (iequal(item_tok, "CONF:LOAD"))      // item_tok = "CONF", so NO MATCH
...
else if (iequal(item_tok, "CONF:DEFAULT"))   // item_tok = "CONF", so NO MATCH
```

Since item_tok is just "CONF" (not "CONF:DEFAULT"), none of the `CONF:*` handlers match.
The code falls through to the final `else` clause which outputs:
```
ERR Unknown SYST item
```

**Actual vs Expected**:
```
Command:  SYST:CONF:DEFAULT
Expected: OK
Actual:   ERR Unknown SYST item
```

**Evidence from Test Output**:
```
STEP 1: Disabling logging...
SYST:LOG:LEVEL OFF       → OK ✓ (works because "LOG:LEVEL" parsing works differently)

STEP 2: Resetting to defaults...
SYST:CONF:DEFAULT        → ERR Unknown SYST item ✗
```

**Why It Doesn't Work**:
The implementation expects item_tok to contain the full sub-command including colons:
- Line 1480: `iequal(item_tok, "CONF:SAVE")`
- Line 1581: `iequal(item_tok, "CONF:DEFAULT")`

But item_tok can never contain colons because `:` is stripped as a delimiter at line 758:
```cpp
while (*p == ' ' || *p == '\t' || *p == ':')
    ++p;
```

### Issue #2: Response Format Bug - RDS:PS? and RDS:RT?
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Commands Affected**:
- `RDS:PS?` - TIMEOUT
- `RDS:RT?` - TIMEOUT

**Root Cause**:
The response format is incorrect. In text mode (non-JSON), the code outputs:
```cpp
snprintf(b, sizeof(b), "\"PS\":\"%s\"", ps);  // Creates: "PS":"value"
ok_kv(b);                                      // Outputs: OK "PS":"value"
```

This creates a malformed response `OK "PS":"value"` which looks like incomplete JSON.
The serial test harness times out waiting for a proper response format.

**Expected Format** (from docs/SerialConsole.md):
```
Command: RDS:PS?
Response: OK PS=value
```

**Actual Response**:
```
OK "PS":"value"   ← Incorrect format (looks like JSON but in text mode)
```

**Code Location**:
- Line 1036: `snprintf(b, sizeof(b), "\"PS\":\"%s\"", ps);`
- Line 1060: `snprintf(b, sizeof(b), "\"RT\":\"%s\"", rt);`

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Text mode should use format: `PS=value`
- JSON mode should use format: `{"ok":true,"data":{"PS":"value"}}`
- Current code mixes both formats and breaks the protocol

---

### Issue #3: RDS:PTY:LIST? Timeout
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Commands Affected**:
- `RDS:PTY:LIST?` - TIMEOUT

**Root Cause**:
Same response format issue as PS?/RT?. The code at line 899 calls:
```cpp
ok_kv(list_buf);
```

Which outputs in text mode:
```
OK [complex list data]
```

But the issue is that LIST responses might have similar format problems.

Actually, looking at the code more carefully, the LIST? handler should work. Let me check line 894-899:
```cpp
snprintf(entry, sizeof(entry), "%s%u=%s",
         list_buf[0] ? "," : "", e.c, e.n);
strncat(list_buf, entry,
        sizeof(list_buf) - strlen(list_buf) - 1);
```

This builds a proper format like: `0=NONE,1=NEWS,2=INFORMATION,...`

However, the test timeout might be due to screen buffering or the response being too long.

Let me verify: the test is looking for "POP_MUSIC" in the response. The PTY list includes "POP_MUSIC" at position 10. The response should contain it. The timeout suggests the response isn't coming through or is corrupted.

**Possible Cause**: The response might be too large for the buffer or the serial line is getting corrupted by other output.

## Summary of Issues

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Required | Severity |
|-------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| SYST:CONF:* fails | Item token doesn't contain colons (`:` is delimiter) | Re-parse item_tok + rest to handle nested commands | CRITICAL |
| RDS:PS?/RT? timeout | Wrong response format (`"PS":"value"` instead of `PS=value`) | Fix snprintf format string | CRITICAL |
| RDS:PTY:LIST? timeout | Possibly related to PS?/RT? format issue or buffer overflow | Verify response size, add debugging | CRITICAL |

## Recommended Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Response Format (PS? and RT?)
**Priority**: HIGH (blocks testing of multiple commands)

**Changes**:
1. Line 1036: Change `"\"PS\":\"%s\""` to `"PS=%s"`
2. Line 1060: Change `"\"RT\":\"%s\""` to `"RT=%s"`
3. Line 899: Verify PTY:LIST? response format is correct (should be already correct based on code review)

**Expected Impact**:
- `RDS:PS?` returns: `OK PS=value`
- `RDS:RT?` returns: `OK RT=value`
- Tests pass immediately after fix

### Phase 2: Fix SYST:CONF:* Command Parsing
**Priority**: CRITICAL (all config commands broken)

**Strategy**:
The current parsing logic with `:` as delimiter prevents CONF:* commands from working. Options:

**Option A** (Recommended): Fix the nested command handling
- When item_tok = "CONF", read next token from `rest` to get the subcommand
- This maintains backward compatibility with existing command structure

**Option B**: Change delimiter
- Remove `:` from token delimiters
- This would break other commands that rely on `:` for structure

**Option C**: Use a different parser for SYST group
- Special-case SYST commands to handle nested colons differently

**Recommended Approach** (Option A):
```cpp
else if (iequal(item_tok, "CONF"))
{
    // Parse subcommand from rest
    char sub_cmd[32];
    const char *rp = rest;
    next_token(rp, sub_cmd, sizeof(sub_cmd));

    if (iequal(sub_cmd, "SAVE"))
    {
        // ... existing CONF:SAVE logic ...
    }
    else if (iequal(sub_cmd, "LOAD"))
    {
        // ... existing CONF:LOAD logic ...
    }
    // ... etc
}
```

**Expected Impact**:
- All `SYST:CONF:*` commands work correctly
- Configuration save/load/default/delete functionality restored
- Boot-time config loading works

### Phase 3: Verify PTY:LIST? Response
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**After** Phase 1 is complete, test `RDS:PTY:LIST?` again to see if it passes.

---

## Testing Strategy

1. **After Fix Phase 1**: Re-run PS?/RT? tests, verify responses match expected format
2. **After Fix Phase 2**: Re-run all SYST:CONF:* tests
3. **Final**: Run complete test suite to ensure 100% pass rate
4. **Regression**: Verify that other commands still work correctly
